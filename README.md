# TEITOK API Scripts

In this repository, we collect useful scripts to interact with TEITOK corpora using the TEITOK API. We attempt to provide some script in all popular programming languages, that can either be used directly or serve as inspiration to perform similar tasks. We invite people to contribute any scripts they develop themselves so that more and more scripts can become available.
